A very simple C# script which lets you scrape the images of ships from KC Wikia.

~~Known issue:~~

~~- Sometimes Wikia will refuse to serve the right HTML for the scraper and hence it will grab the wrong version of a ship's image.~~
*It seems that they've disabled File: directories for non-users, and any calls made to said pages will result in a redirection to actual shipgirl page. Blasted dastards.*
